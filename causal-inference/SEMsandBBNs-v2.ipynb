    "**Structural equation models** (SEMs) are frequently used for causal modeling. In most contemporary uses they are generalizations of the kind of path model described by Sewall Wright. \n",

    "A SEM can have paths, or \"structural\" relations between variables that are either directed or undirected.  There can be exogenous and endogenous variables in a SEM. A SEM can also have _measurement models_ that consist of multiple, fallible indicators defining latent variable.  These measurement are essentially confirmatory factor models.  In general, a SEM can consist of manifest and latent variables in a network of structural relations. \n",
    "\n",
    "SEMs are usually estimated using a variance-covariance matrix of observed variables as the data, and typically using maximum likelihood methods, although simulation methods for estimating Bayesian versions have been used. Means are sometimes also used as input data when SEMs for different groups are to be compared.  Model fit is usually assess by considering some of a rather large number of fit statistics and indexes that have been developed over the years,  the central $\\chi^2$ statistic and the AIC.  Nested models can be compared by statistical difference tests, or by comparing indexes. Equivalence of models for groups can be tested for by assessing the impacts of constraining the parameters to be equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bayesian Belief Networks** (BBNs) are DAGs whose nodes are probability functions. Endogenous nodes are conditioned by their parent nodes. Variables in a BBN can be observed or latent.  They are typically discrete, and so the probability distribution of a node consists of a table. Pearl has used BBNs extensively in his theory of probabilistic causality, of which his \"do-calculus\" is part.  We'll be getting to the do-calc subsequently.  Here we'll consider SEMs of the linear equation type.  "
